Collecting news sources may have concerns about the usage of copyright, so I listed the copyright usage announcement published by these media on their own official website to allay concerns. These contents mentioned as long as non-commercial, non-profit behavior that can be opened to use for free. This app does not engage in profit-making behavior indeed (no ads inserted to profit, or fees, etc.).
The attachment will be enclosed screenshots and links for mention copyright.
